Welcome to the tiConf Mobile Dev Wars Demo game.

Full disclosure:  Much of this code was adapted from the Lanica Alloy Shooter demo application.

This game requires the Platino modules to be installed.  You can download the modules and instructions for installation at http://lanica.co

Currently, I am working adding better end-game conditions, levels and a UFO in the coming weeks!

Enjoy!
